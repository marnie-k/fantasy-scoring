# Fantasy Scoring

## Instructions
In the initial commit to this project, you have been provided with a basic project setup as well as a set of tests which currently fail. Your task is to create a `calculateScore` function which will properly calculate the fantasy score for all known positions, returning 0 when the position is not one of the ones laid out below.

Working in a branch called `answer`, implement your function to get your tests to pass. Once you are done, push your branch up to GitHub, create a pull request, and request review from the instructor.
